Protocol Design

Message Structure
first 10 bytes specify the size of the data
the remaining bytes are purely data
min size 10 bytes
max size 10 + 9999999999 bytes

Messages server sends over the control connection:
list of files in server's current working directory
file transfer errors (for example, filename is not valid)
ephemeral port number

Messages client sends over the control connection:
all commands
connection requests

To set up the file transfer channel:
client issues a file transfer command
server response with an available port
client connects
server/client starts sending the file to the other party

The number of bytes in the file is specified in the first 10 bytes of the message. Files larger than the max size lists above will cause an issue.
